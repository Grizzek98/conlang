# Elothian Word Generator

This program is designed to generate sample verbs, nouns and adjectives for the Elothian conlang.

## Capabilites

You are able to choose between the three main types of words to generate, as well the size of list generated and number of syllables in each generated word. The Elothian language phonetic library is built in with simple rules for syllable creation, including not allowing certain phonemes at the beginning or ending of words.

## Limitations

While there are some rules in place for syllable construction, those rules could be more robust. As it stands, there are still many words generated that are difficult or impossible to pronounce. That being said, you can usually get good words at a rate of about 1/5 words generated (according to my subjectivity, of course >:) )

## Future Work

- Create more rules for syllable / word construction as to not allow impossible pronunciations
- Create additional word generators, perhaps for numbers, adverbs, etc (though this is not strictly necessary as the noun generator can generally be used for all other types as well)
